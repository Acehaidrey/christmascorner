 # Christmas Corner Site
The start to our family christmas corner site. These initiatives are led by Ace and Bruce.

## Getting Started
We will develop the project using the Sublime text editor (to be on the same page though anything would be okay). Below is a list of good add-ons to install to sublime:
* All Autocomplete
* Git Gutter
* Emmet
* Color Highlighter
* SublimeCodeIntel
* DocBlockr
* PlaceHolders

The list contains just a handful of good addons but if you find any others you like feel free to use them! In order to even download those you need to download `Package Control` for sublime. The instructions to install package control can be found [here](https://packagecontrol.io/installation#st2).
All of the above were found from web searches, and primarily from the [tutorialzine](http://tutorialzine.com/2016/10/15-awesome-sublime-text-plugins-for-web-development/) site. [Here](https://packagecontrol.io/) is the link to browse all available packages.

A library that makes web developing a lot easier is called [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). I want you to do the following tutorial in Codecademy: [Adding Bootstrap](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-yjvdd/0/1), to make it easier and give you some familiarity.
 
 Given that, we will have mockups and follow those design decisions. We can start by just creating a static website from html/css and then develop it into a responsive and dynamic site that people can actually use.
 
 ## Todo
 * reach out to people at polarX to see if they have an api to pull the ornament pictures and information. (Ace)
